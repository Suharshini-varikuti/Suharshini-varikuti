Hi, I am Suharshini Varikuti

I’m a recent Computer Science graduate who enjoys learning new technologies and building small projects to understand how things really work.
Right now, I’m exploring web development and learning about AI and machine learning.

I like figuring out how things work behind the scenes — whether it’s a website, a backend API, or a simple machine learning model.
Most of the projects I’ve done are learning-based, but I try to improve with each one.

What I’m currently learning:

Web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React

Backend basics with ASP.NET Core and REST APIs

Python and the basics of Machine Learning

Databases like SQL Server and MySQL


Tools I use:
VS Code, GitHub, SQL Server, Postman, and Git

I enjoy learning by doing, and I use GitHub to keep track of what I’m working on.
I’m still exploring what I like most between web development and AI, but I’m curious about both and always open to learning something new.
